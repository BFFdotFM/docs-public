## What can I do with it?

You can analyse what's being played and by who, you can consume our live broadcast stream to analyse audio, or download podcast recordings from our archives.

We've also created a special bundle of _every song we ever tracked,_ dating back to 2014. **300,000 data points** from which you can explore the tracks, albums and bands that were big in our world over the years. Get an eclectic signal into music that comes from ourside of the mainstream.
