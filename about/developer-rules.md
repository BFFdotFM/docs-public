# Developer Rules

At time of writing, BFF.fm's developer platform is emergent and experimental, so these rules are somewhat loose and informal and will develop over time along with the station's technology itself. If you have any questions, please Tweet to @bffdotfm or email tech@bff.fm.

## In general

* You should use the BFF.fm data and APIs with respect — do not overwhelm our servers or resources. 
* We will not support the use of our data and content in projects that seek to or enable the harm of others.
* Please credit BFF.fm appropriately in your applications that build on our work.
* Please make use of the `app_id` parameter is requests to our API with a reverse URI form \(e.g. `com.example.bff.app`  so that we may understand who is making use of our endpoints. Drop us a message to @bffdotfm on Twitter or tech@bff.fm if you want to identify yourselves! \(In future, we'll consider a more formal system for this.\)

## Data Licensing

At time of writing we have not applied an explicit license to our data. We are considering an appropriate way to share this data with the community, but for the time being, please contact us if you want to discuss specifics.
