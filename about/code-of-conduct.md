# Code of Conduct

Just as with our on-air community, BFF.fm is committing to providing a safe, and friendly envionment for technical contributions.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants in our community. We require that everyone abide by this Code when contributing to and collaborating on BFF.fm technical projects.

Open source software  powers streaming radio stack all across the web, and has been a vital and integral part of BFF.fm's operation since the very start. BFF.fm, our staff, and volunteers aspire to be positive contributors to the wider internet radio community. We're committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all participants, and we expect everyone to treat each other with respect and courtesy.

###  Expectations

* Treat others with dignity and respect.
* Refrain from demeaning or discriminatory behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
* Alert BFF.fm staff and/or volunteers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

### How we handle unacceptable behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct in BFF.fm community spaces, and the spaces of projects that BFF.fm hosts, or is involved in.

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. If someone is deemed to be acting in an unacceptable manner, we will take any action deemed appropriate to support and ensure the safety of our community, including removal or exclusion of indivuduals from BFF.fm projects.

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, or notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a volunteer or BFF.fm Technical Comittee member as soon as you are able.
